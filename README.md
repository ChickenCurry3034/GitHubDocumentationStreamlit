# GitHub Docs by Aarush Mane

## The Purpose

This website created through Python and Streamlit has the major purpose of teaching newer GitHub users of Version Control in GitHub. Version Control is basically updating some code and allowing the rest of the world to access that new code.

## Option 1

In order to run this website in your local computer, there are two ways. One of the ways os a way which you can also edit this website includes having Streamlit downloaded in your computer.

### Streamlit Installation

To install streamlit, you need to use the command in your local command prompt:

```python
pip install streamlit
```

To check if this installation worked or not, the command needed to be used is:

```python
streamlit hello
```

When programming, if you need the documentation for Steamlit, you can use the function:

```python
streamlit docs
```

### The Rest of Option 1

The main code is stored in GHDocs.py. Running this file in Python IDLE will result in a website in the user's browser. Skip Option 2 to view the next steps.

## Option 2

When programming this website, I have used Streamlit Cloud to deploy this website. The link for access is: https://chickencurry3034-githubdocumentationstreamlit-ghdocs-v4nw9z.streamlitapp.com/. The rest of this process is the same as Option 1 as it is shown below.

## The Rest

To use this website, the user must click on the drop-down menu below the text stating “Pick the following Git Commands,” and the code (which they can copy and paste), a short description of the code, a visual example of the code in action, and an explanation of the image will show up.
